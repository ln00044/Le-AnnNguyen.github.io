    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <dl> 
      <dt>Do I have to book an appointment?</dt>
      <dd>No. We no longer accept appointments and only do walk-ins.</dd>
        
      <dt>What's the difference between regular polish vs. gel polish vs. dip powder?</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dipping Powder:</strong> Dipping powder lasts the longest out of all the options as it is the thickest but also creates 
            the most damage to the nail.
            One of the pros is that there are also more options for designs like ombre.</li>
          <li><strong>Gel Polish:</strong> Gel dries quicker than regular polish but lasts less than dipping powder. This is a good option for kids who can't
            sit still. Damage to the nail only occurs on improper removal.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Polish:</strong> This is the polish most customers are used to. Some cons are taking the longest to dry and the quickest to chip.
             Other pros may be that it's good for people who want to change their polish frequently without damaging the nail.</li>
        </ul>
