    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <p>Nail Art in Calhoun opened its doors in October 2020. It is co&hyphen;owned and managed by Kimmy and Larry Nguyen,
       who previously owned a salon and have been in the industry for over 20 years. After selling their previous salon
       in Fort Oglethorpe and the shutdown of COVID-19, the two decided to open another salon closer to home.
        They strive to create a relaxing environment while providing quality service. Please don't hesitate to
         reach out, and we hope to see you soon!</p>

  <h2>Your Satisfaction is Our Priority</h2>
  <p>Keeping our commitment to cleanliness, safety, and hygiene, we sterilize and sanitize our equipment for all 
   services and treatments. Your health and safety are our utmost priorities. All pedicure liners are disposable to 
   prevent the spread of bacteria, fungus, and infectious diseases. Our Autoclave machine sterilizes all metal instruments 
   after each use, while we discard nail files, buffers, and clippers after a single use. These measures help us adhere to 
   the highest level of sanitization standards, ensuring the safety of our services and allowing you to relax 
   and enjoy your manicure and pedicure.
